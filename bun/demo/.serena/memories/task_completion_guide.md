# Task Completion Guide

When a task is completed:

1.  **Verify**: Ensure the server runs (`bun server.ts`) and endpoints (`/health`, `/alt`, `/describe`) work as expected.
2.  **Test**: Run `bun test` if tests are available/added.
3.  **Clean up**: Remove any temporary files created.
4.  **Document**: Update `project_overview.md` or other memories if significant architectural changes occurred.
